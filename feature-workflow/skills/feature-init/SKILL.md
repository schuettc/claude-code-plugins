# Initialize Feature Workflow

## DO THIS NOW - NO EXPLORATION NEEDED

Run this exact command immediately:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/feature-init/scripts/init.py" "$(pwd)"
```

**STOP. Do not search for files. Do not read files. Do not explore. Just run the command above.**

The script creates `docs/features/` and `docs/features/DASHBOARD.md`.

That's it. Nothing else to do.
