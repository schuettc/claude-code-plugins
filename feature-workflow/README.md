# Feature Workflow Plugin

**Version:** 3.0.0

A Claude Code plugin for feature lifecycle management using a directory-based architecture. Capture feature ideas, plan implementations, and complete features with quality gates.

## What's New in 3.0

- **Feature Directory Architecture** - Each feature lives in its own directory (`docs/features/[id]/`)
- **Status by File Presence** - Status is determined by which files exist (idea.md, plan.md, shipped.md)
- **Auto-Generated Dashboard** - `DASHBOARD.md` is automatically regenerated by hooks
- **Simpler Mental Model** - No JSON manipulation, just markdown files

## Requirements

- **jq** - Required for JSON parsing in hooks
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install jq

  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install jq

  # Check installation
  jq --version
  ```

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)
```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add schuettc/claude-code-plugins

# Install the plugin
/plugin install feature-workflow@schuettc-claude-code-plugins
```

### Development Mode
```bash
git clone https://github.com/schuettc/claude-code-plugins.git
claude --plugin-dir ./claude-code-plugins/feature-workflow
```

## Feature Directory Architecture

Features are stored in directories with status determined by file presence:

```
docs/features/
├── DASHBOARD.md              # Auto-generated, read-only for Claude
├── my-feature/
│   ├── idea.md               # Problem statement + metadata (backlog)
│   ├── plan.md               # Implementation plan (in-progress)
│   └── shipped.md            # Completion notes (completed)
└── another-feature/
    └── idea.md
```

### Status Detection by File Presence

| Files Present | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| `idea.md` only | backlog |
| `idea.md` + `plan.md` | in-progress |
| `idea.md` + `plan.md` + `shipped.md` | completed |

### Key Principles

| Principle | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Directory-based** | Each feature has its own directory |
| **Status by files** | No JSON status field - file presence determines status |
| **Auto-generated index** | DASHBOARD.md regenerated on every change |
| **Human-readable** | All data in markdown with YAML frontmatter |
| **Claude reads, hook writes** | Claude reads DASHBOARD.md, hooks regenerate it |

## Commands

### `/feature-capture`

Interactive workflow for adding features to the backlog.

**Usage:**
```
/feature-capture
```

**What it does:**
1. Asks questions to capture the feature:
   - Item type (Feature, Enhancement, Tech Debt, Bug Fix)
   - Feature name
   - Problem statement
   - Priority (P0, P1, P2)
   - Effort estimate (Small, Medium, Large)
   - Impact level (Low, Medium, High)
   - Affected areas (optional)

2. Creates `docs/features/[id]/idea.md` with frontmatter metadata

3. Hook automatically regenerates DASHBOARD.md

### `/feature-plan [feature-id]`

Start implementing a feature from the backlog with comprehensive planning.

**Usage:**
```
/feature-plan dark-mode-toggle
```

Or without an ID to see available items:
```
/feature-plan
```

**What it does:**
1. **Feature Selection** - Choose from DASHBOARD.md backlog or validate provided ID
2. **Requirements Analysis** - Deep dive with project-manager agent
3. **System Design** - Adaptive architecture planning based on feature type
4. **Implementation Plan** - Creates structured plan with actionable steps
5. **Write plan.md** - Creates the plan file, triggering status change
6. **Kickoff Summary** - Creates todos and provides next steps

Writing `plan.md` triggers the hook to:
- Set terminal statusline to feature ID
- Regenerate DASHBOARD.md (feature moves to In Progress)

### `/feature-ship [feature-id]`

Complete a feature with quality gates.

**Usage:**
```
/feature-ship dark-mode-toggle
```

Or without an ID to see in-progress items:
```
/feature-ship
```

**What it does:**
1. **Pre-flight Check** - Verify feature is in-progress
2. **Security Review** - Run security-reviewer agent (BLOCKS on Critical/High)
3. **QA Validation** - Run qa-engineer agent
4. **Final Verification** - Run tests, type checks, build
5. **Write shipped.md** - Creates completion notes, triggering status change
6. **Summary** - Display completion report

Writing `shipped.md` triggers the hook to:
- Clear terminal statusline
- Regenerate DASHBOARD.md (feature moves to Completed)

```

## How Hooks Work

Status transitions are handled automatically when Claude writes feature files.

### Hook Architecture

```
Claude writes file  →  PostToolUse hook detects  →  Script executes
       │                        │                        │
  idea.md/plan.md/          Matches pattern        Regenerates
  shipped.md               docs/features/*/*.md    DASHBOARD.md
```

### What Triggers Hook Actions

| File Written | Hook Action |
|--------------|-------------|
| `docs/features/[id]/idea.md` | Regenerate DASHBOARD.md |
| `docs/features/[id]/plan.md` | Set statusline + regenerate DASHBOARD.md |
| `docs/features/[id]/shipped.md` | Clear statusline + regenerate DASHBOARD.md |

### Blocked Writes

The PreToolUse hook blocks direct writes to:
- `docs/features/DASHBOARD.md` (auto-generated)

## Terminal Statusline

The plugin displays the current feature in Claude Code's status line.

**Setup script** (`~/dotfiles/config/claude/statusline.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.session_id')
MODEL=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name // "Claude"')

mkdir -p ~/.claude/sessions

if [[ -n "$ITERM_SESSION_ID" ]]; then
  echo "$SESSION_ID" > ~/.claude/sessions/iterm-${ITERM_SESSION_ID}.session
fi

FEATURE=""
if [[ -f ~/.claude/sessions/${SESSION_ID}.feature ]]; then
  FEATURE=$(cat ~/.claude/sessions/${SESSION_ID}.feature)
fi

if [[ -n "$FEATURE" ]]; then
  echo "[$FEATURE] $MODEL"
else
  echo "[$MODEL] ${SESSION_ID:0:8}"
fi
```

**Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/dotfiles/config/claude/statusline.sh"
  }
}
```

## Skills (Model-Invoked)

Skills are **automatically invoked by Claude** when context is relevant.

| Skill | Behavior | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **checking-backlog** | Silent (read-only) | Auto-check DASHBOARD.md when discussing features |
| **loading-feature-context** | Silent (read-only) | Auto-load idea.md/plan.md during implementation |
| **tracking-progress** | Ask first (writes) | Update plan.md progress log when completing tasks |
| **displaying-status** | Silent (read-only) | Quick status overview when asking "what's next?" |
| **guarding-scope** | Silent (read-only) | Flag scope creep, suggest adding to backlog |

## Included Agents

The plugin includes specialized agents dispatched based on feature type and workflow phase:

### Planning & Design Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **project-manager** | Requirements analysis, user stories |
| **code-archaeologist** | Reverse-engineer legacy code |
| **system-designer** | High-level architecture |
| **api-designer** | API/GraphQL design |
| **frontend-architect** | React component architecture |
| **integration-designer** | Frontend-backend integration |
| **ux-optimizer** | UX optimization |

### Quality Gate Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **security-reviewer** | OWASP Top 10, CVE scanning |
| **qa-engineer** | Test coverage, acceptance criteria |
| **test-generator** | TDD - write tests before implementation |
| **documentation-agent** | Documentation maintenance |

## Troubleshooting

### "jq is required but not installed"

Install jq using your package manager (see Requirements section).

### DASHBOARD.md not updating

Manually regenerate:
```bash
./feature-workflow/hooks/generate-dashboard.sh /path/to/project
```

### Hook not firing

1. Verify the plugin is enabled: `/plugin list`
2. Check hook scripts are executable: `chmod +x feature-workflow/hooks/*.sh`

## Philosophy

**"Never Code Without a Plan"**

This plugin enforces thoughtful planning before implementation:

1. **Capture ideas quickly** - `/feature-capture` takes ~5 minutes
2. **Plan thoroughly when ready** - `/feature-plan` takes 15-30 minutes but saves hours
3. **Ship with confidence** - `/feature-ship` ensures quality gates pass
4. **Human-readable everything** - All data in markdown, no JSON to edit
